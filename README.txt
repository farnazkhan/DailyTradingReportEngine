Daily Trade report engine is a console based application.

It has options from the menu to be choosen from action [1 to 6]. Each action described in detail.

The main class is the ConsoleApplication which has switch case to handle above menu.
I have also initialzed the application with few trade transactions. And then have provided to create new trade transaction.

However, this is a simple Java application build on JDK 8_152u, since there was a resctriction of not to use external library (or can use juz one or two).

You can execute this application by importing in IDE eclipse.
